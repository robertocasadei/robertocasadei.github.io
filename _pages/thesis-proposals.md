# Thesis Proposals

Take a look at my [research activity](/research) and contact me via e-mail for thesis proposals.

Kinds of thesis:

- *Research-oriented* -- these aim at providing (small) contributions to the state of the art in some target field;
- *Software engineering projects* -- these are works aimed at developing complex software (cf., distributed systems);
- *Surveys / Systematic Literature Reviews* -- the works include a comprehensive study of the literature (e.g., on self-* systems, multi-agent systems, collective intelligence) and an original synthesis (e.g., in terms of a taxonomy, learned lessons, challenges and opportunities).

## Proposals

- *Graphical application monitoring and debugging* -- with links to Model@Runtime

## Past co-supervised theses
