My name is Roberto Casadei.
I got a PhD in Computer Science and Engineering from Alma Mater Studiorum - Universit√† di Bologna.
My research interests include programming languages and paradigms, distributed computing, self-adaptive computing, collective intelligence and systemics. My current research effort revolves around Aggregate Computing, a paradigm for programming Collective Adaptive Systems (CAS).
