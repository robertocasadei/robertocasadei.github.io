My name is Roberto Casadei.
I am an assistant professor at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Alma Mater Studiorum - Universit√† di Bologna.
I got a PhD in Computer Science and Engineering from the same university.
My research interests revolve around software engineering for self-adaptive systems and collective intelligence. My current research effort focusses on Aggregate Computing and related scientific/engineering issues.
