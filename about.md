My name is Roberto Casadei.
I am a PhD student in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Bologna.
My interests include programming paradigms, distributed computing, and systemics.
My current research effort revolves around Aggregate Computing, a paradigm for programming Collective Adaptive Systems (CAS).
