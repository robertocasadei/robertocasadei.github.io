abstract = {Distributed collective systems are systems formed by homogeneous dynamic collections of devices acting in a shared environment to pursue a joint task or goal. Typical applications emerge in the context of wireless sensor networks, robot swarms, groups of wearable-augmented people, and computing infrastructures. Programming such systems is notoriously hard, due to requirements of scalability, concurrency, faults, and difficulty in making desired collective behaviour ultimately emerge: ad-hoc languages and mechanisms have been proposed threads like spatial computing, macro-programming, and field-based coordination. In this paper we present the eXchange Calculus (XC), formalising a tiny set of key mechanisms, usable across many different languages and platforms, allowing to express the overall interactive behaviour of distributed collective systems in a declarative way. In this approach, computation (executed in asynchronous rounds), communication (which is neighbour-based), and state over time, are all expressed by a single declarative construct, called exchange. We provide a formalisation of XC in terms of syntax, device-level and network-level semantics, prove a number of properties of the calculus, and discuss applicability considering a smart city scenario. XC is implemented as a DSL in Scala and in C++, with different trade-offs in terms of productivity and platform targetting.}

abstract = {An interesting and innovative activity in Collective Intelligence systems is Sentiment Analysis (SA) which, starting from users' feedback, aims to identify their opinion about a specific subject, for example in order to develop/improve/customize products and services. The feedback gathering, however, is complex, time-consuming, and often invasive, possibly resulting in decreased truthfulness and reliability for its outcome. Moreover, the subsequent feedback processing may suffer from scalability, cost, and privacy issues when the sample size is large or the data to be processed is sensitive. Internet of Things (IoT) and Edge Intelligence (EI) can greatly help in both aspects by providing, respectively, a pervasive and transparent way to collect a huge amount of heterogeneous data from users (e.g., audio, images, video, etc.) and an efficient, low-cost, and privacy-preserving solution to locally analyze them without resorting to Cloud computing-based platforms. Therefore, in this paper we outline an innovative collective SA system which leverages on IoT and EI (specifically, TinyML techniques and the EdgeImpulse platform) to gather and immediately process audio in the proximity of entities-of-interest in order to determine whether audience’ opinions are positive, negative, or neutral. The architecture of the proposed system, exemplified in a museum use case, is presented, and a preliminary, yet very promising, implementation is shown, reveling interesting insights towards its full development.},

    abstract = "{Collectiveness is an important property of many systems—both natural and artificial. By exploiting a large number of individuals, it is often possible to produce effects that go far beyond the capabilities of the smartest individuals or even to produce intelligent collective behavior out of not-so-intelligent individuals. Indeed, collective intelligence, namely, the capability of a group to act collectively in a seemingly intelligent way, is increasingly often a design goal of engineered computational systems—motivated by recent technoscientific trends like the Internet of Things, swarm robotics, and crowd computing, to name only a few. For several years, the collective intelligence observed in natural and artificial systems has served as a source of inspiration for engineering ideas, models, and mechanisms. Today, artificial and computational collective intelligence are recognized research topics, spanning various techniques, kinds of target systems, and application domains. However, there is still a lot of fragmentation in the research panorama of the topic within computer science, and the verticality of most communities and contributions makes it difficult to extract the core underlying ideas and frames of reference. The challenge is to identify, place in a common structure, and ultimately connect the different areas and methods addressing intelligent collectives. To address this gap, this article considers a set of broad scoping questions providing a map of collective intelligence research, mostly by the point of view of computer scientists and engineers. Accordingly, it covers preliminary notions, fundamental concepts, and the main research perspectives, identifying opportunities and challenges for researchers on artificial and computational collective intelligence engineering.}",

abstract = {Swarm intelligence leverages collective behaviours emerging from interaction and activity of several “simple” agents to solve problems in various environments. One problem of interest in large swarms featuring a variety of sub-goals is swarm clustering, where the individuals of a swarm are assigned or choose to belong to zero or more groups, also called clusters. In this work, we address the sensing-based swarm clustering problem, where clusters are defined based on both the values sensed from the environment and the spatial distribution of the values and the agents. Moreover, we address it in a setting characterised by decentralisation of computation and interaction, and dynamicity of values and mobility of agents. For the solution, we propose to use the field-based computing paradigm, where computation and interaction are expressed in terms of a functional manipulation of fields, distributed and evolving data structures mapping each individual of the system to values over time. We devise a solution to sensing-based swarm clustering leveraging multiple concurrent field computations with limited domain and evaluate the approach experimentally by means of simulations, showing that the programmed swarms form clusters that well reflect the underlying environmental phenomena dynamics.},

ABSTRACT = {The engineering of large-scale cyber-physical systems (CPS) increasingly relies on principles from self-organisation and collective computing, enabling these systems to cooperate and adapt in dynamic environments. CPS engineering also often leverages digital twins that provide synchronised logical counterparts of physical entities. In contrast, sensor networks rely on the different but related concept of virtual device that provides an abstraction of a group of sensors. In this work, we study how such concepts can contribute to the engineering of self-organising CPSs. To that end, we analyse the concepts and devise modelling constructs, distinguishing between identity correspondence and execution relationships. Based on this analysis, we then contribute to the novel concept of &ldquo;collective digital twin&rdquo; (CDT) that captures the logical counterpart of a collection of physical devices. A CDT can also be &ldquo;augmented&rdquo; with purely virtual devices, which may be exploited to steer the self-organisation process of the CDT and its physical counterpart. We underpin the novel concept with experiments in the context of the pulverisation framework of aggregate computing, showing how augmented CDTs provide a holistic, modular, and cyber-physically integrated system view that can foster the engineering of self-organising CPSs.},

abstract = {A key goal of edge computing is to achieve “distributed sensing” out of data continuously generated from a multitude of interconnected physical devices. The traditional approach is to gather information into sparse collector devices by relying on hop-by-hop accumulation, but issues of reactivity and fragility naturally arise in scenarios with high mobility. We propose novel algorithms for dynamic data summarisation across space, supporting high reactivity and resilience by specific techniques maximising the speed at which information propagates towards collectors. Such algorithms support idempotent and arithmetic aggregation operators and, under reasonable network assumptions, are proved to achieve optimal reactivity. We provide evaluation via simulation: first in multiple scenarios showing improvement over the state of art, and then by a case study in edge data mining, which conveys the practical impact in higher-level distributed sensing patterns.}

ABSTRACT = {Research and technology developments on autonomous agents and autonomic computing promote a vision of artificial systems that are able to resiliently manage themselves and autonomously deal with issues at runtime in dynamic environments. Indeed, autonomy can be leveraged to unburden humans from mundane tasks (cf. driving and autonomous vehicles), from the risk of operating in unknown or perilous environments (cf. rescue scenarios), or to support timely decision-making in complex settings (cf. data-centre operations). Beyond the results that individual autonomous agents can carry out, a further opportunity lies in the collaboration of multiple agents or robots. Emerging macro-paradigms provide an approach to programming whole collectives towards global goals. Aggregate computing is one such paradigm, formally grounded in a calculus of computational fields enabling functional composition of collective behaviours that could be proved, under certain technical conditions, to be self-stabilising. In this work, we address the concept of collective autonomy, i.e., the form of autonomy that applies at the level of a group of individuals. As a contribution, we define an agent control architecture for aggregate multi-agent systems, discuss how the aggregate computing framework relates to both individual and collective autonomy, and show how it can be used to program collective autonomous behaviour. We exemplify the concepts through a simulated case study, and outline a research roadmap towards reliable aggregate autonomy.},

abstract = "Edge computing promotes the execution of complex computational processes without the cloud, i.e., on top of the heterogeneous, articulated, and possibly mobile systems composed of IoT and edge devices. Such a pervasive smart fabric augments our environment with computing and networking capabilities. This leads to a complex and dynamic ecosystem of devices that should not only exhibit individual intelligence but also collective intelligence—the ability to take group decisions or process knowledge among autonomous units of a distributed environment. Self-adaptation and self-organisation mechanisms are also typically required to ensure continuous and inherent toleration of changes of various kinds, to distribution of devices, energy available, computational load, as well as faults. To achieve this behaviour in a massively distributed setting like edge computing demands, we seek for identifying proper abstractions, and engineering tools therefore, to smoothly capture collective behaviour, adaptivity, and dynamic injection and execution of concurrent distributed activities. Accordingly, we elaborate on a notion of “aggregate process” as a concurrent collective computation whose execution and interactions are sustained by a dynamic team of devices, whose spatial region can opportunistically vary over time. We ground this notion by extending the aggregate computing model and toolchain with new constructs to instantiate aggregate processes and regulate key aspects of their lifecycle. By virtue of an open-source implementation in the ScaFi framework, we show basic programming examples as well as case studies of edge computing, evaluated by simulation in realistic settings."

abstract="A recently proposed approach to the rigorous engineering of collective adaptive systems is the aggregate computing paradigm, which operationalises the idea of expressing collective adaptive behaviour by a global perspective as a functional composition of dynamic computational fields (i.e., structures mapping a collection of individual devices of a collective to computational values over time). In this paper, we present FScaFi, a core language that captures the essence of exploiting field computations in mainstream functional languages, and which is based on a semantic model for field computations leveraging the novel notion of ``computation against a neighbour''. Such a construct models expressions whose evaluation depends on the same evaluation that occurred on a neighbour, thus abstracting communication actions and, crucially, enabling deep and straightforward integration in the Scala programming language, by the ScaFi incarnation. We cover syntax and informal semantics of FScaFi, provide examples of collective adaptive behaviour development in ScaFi, and delineate future work.",

_abstract = "Aggregate computing is an emerging approach to the engineering of complex coordination for distributed systems, based on viewing system interactions in terms of information propagating through collectives of devices, rather than in terms of individual devices and their interaction with their peers and environment. The foundation of this approach is the distillation of a number of prior approaches, both formal and pragmatic, proposed under the umbrella of field-based coordination, and culminating into the field calculus, a universal functional programming model for the specification and composition of collective behaviours with equivalent local and aggregate semantics. This foundation has been elaborated into a layered approach to engineering coordination of complex distributed systems, building up to pragmatic applications through intermediate layers encompassing reusable libraries of program components. Furthermore, some of these components are formally shown to satisfy formal properties like self-stabilisation, which transfer to whole application services by functional composition. In this survey, we trace the development and antecedents of field calculus, review the field calculus itself and the current state of aggregate computing theory and practice, and discuss a roadmap of current research directions with implications for the development of a broad range of distributed systems."
